    "text": "Enough esoteric wandering. The original version of this assignment focused on the relative value of draft picks in the NHL. This version has a more specific question. What might picks in the range of pick 31 conceivably yield? How often do picks in that range yield players of Elias Lindholm’s value?\nI guess we’d better figure out what Elias Lindholm brings to the table.\nCan you find him in our existing data? Can you think of a way to highlight him in the context of number of games played? What other kinds of data might we need to fairly evaluate Lindholm and pick 31?\nYou will be surprised how these seemingly simple questions force you to explore the nuances of working with and visualizing tabular data."

    "text": "Question\n\nWe are trying to address the notion of trading a pick from round 1 for picks from round 2 and 3. Add visual channels to this plot that will help us make that decision.\n\nAnswer：To address the strategy of trading a first-round pick for second and third-round picks, adding color coding to the visualization can greatly enhance decision-making clarity. Specifically, we could represent first-round picks in red, second-round picks in yellow, and third-round picks in blue. This color scheme will provide an immediate visual distinction between the rounds, aiding in the evaluation of the value proposition of such trades。\n\nCreate a caption and better axis labels for this figure.\n\nAnswer: For the figure caption and improved axis labels, a proposed caption could be: “2018 NHL Draft: Analyzing the Impact of Draft Position on Career Progression.” The horizontal axis label could be refined to “Overall Draft Position,” clearly indicating the sequence in which players were selected in the draft. The vertical axis label could be enhanced to “NHL Games Played,” directly correlating the draft position with professional performance metrics.\n\nWhat if we wanted to use more than just the 2018 draft class?\n\nAnswer: To incorporate data beyond the 2018 draft class, creating separate scatter plots for each year could be one approach. Alternatively, integrating the data into a single comprehensive chart using varied colors or markers to differentiate between years could provide a holistic view of trends over time, facilitating a more informed comparison across different draft classes."

    "text": "Question\n\nAdding a visual channel indicating draft round.\n\nAnswer: To visually represent the draft round in our analysis, we can employ color coding for the bars, each color representing a different draft round.\n\nFixing the order of the x axis.\n\nAnswer: Regarding the organization of the x-axis, it would be beneficial to arrange it according to the overall draft position. This arrangement facilitates an intuitive analysis of the relationship between draft round and overall draft position, aiding in the decision-making process.\n\nMaking a caption and better axis labels.\n\nAnswer:\n\na suggested caption is: “2018 NHL Draft: Analyzing Player Performance by Draft Position.” This title concisely communicates the chart’s purpose. Enhancing the x-axis label to “Overall Draft Position” and the y-axis label to “Total NHL Games Played” will clarify the axes’ significance, focusing on the broader trends rather than individual player names.\n\n\nFixing the values of the x axis labels so they aren’t such a mess.\n\nAnswer: To address the clutter of x-axis labels, substituting individual names with their overall draft positions is a practical solution. This approach maintains the chart’s relevance to decision-making by emphasizing positional data over personal identification, streamlining the visual representation for better analysis."

Write a little critique of this visualizaiton that:\n\nConsiders a player who played hundreds of games over their first five years vs a player who played one game in five years.\nEvaluates the relative value of a second round pick and a third round pick.\n\nAnswer:\n\nA player who has played hundreds of games is weighted the same as a player who only played one game, which does not reflect their actual contribution to the league or their team.\nIt’s challenging for the viewer to assess the relative difference between the number of players from the second and third rounds, which is crucial when evaluating the value of draft picks from these rounds."

    "text": "Question\n\nDo these visualizations change as a function of player position?\nAnswer: Certainly, player position significantly influences career trajectories, including the typical length of a career, the number of games played, and their development paths. Different positions have varying demands and expectations, which can impact the metrics used to evaluate a player’s success and contribution.\nIs the number of NHL games played really the best metric to use?\nAnswer: Regarding the metric of NHL games played, it is not the most comprehensive measure of a player’s potential or contribution. Relying solely on this metric can overlook important aspects such as the quality of performance, impact on team success, and other valuable skills brought to the game. A more holistic evaluation should incorporate multiple metrics to capture a player’s overall impact and value more accurately."

utilized lines as markers and position as the channel. Since position on a common scale is the highest-ranking channel for ordered attributes, it allows for easy differentiation of production levels across different locations.In Figure 2, I again used lines as markers but employed color as the channel. Because color is a lower-ranking channel for ordered attributes, it does not easily distinguish production levels across different locations.\nIn Figures 3 and 4, I used lines and areas as marks, differentiating them using color and position. The distinction is that, in Figure 3, I used contrasting colors like blue, red, and green to differentiate various locations, whereas in Figure 4, I used shades of gray, including light gray, gray, and dark gray, which made the chart more difficult to distinguish.\nIn Figures 5 and 6, both utilized lines and areas as marks, with position as the differentiator. The difference in Figure 6 is the addition of color as an extra channel. While redundancy can be desirable, area interferes with hue, with larger shapes having more visual salience.\nIn Figures 7 and 8, I demonstrated the use of lines to represent the average monthly temperatures during the wheat growing season across different locations. The key difference is that in Figure 7, I used a red popout to highlight Aberdeen’s temperature curve, making it easy to locate. In contrast, in Figure 8, I used the same color for all three locations, making it difficult to immediately identify the curve for Aberdeen."

Understanding the current state and future outlook of the university’s research funding portfolio is crucial for informed decision-making by university leadership. This post aims to address three key questions:\n\nWhat is the current state of UI’s active research awards, including their duration, amount, and principal investigators?\nHow has the proportional representation of new awards from different funding sources changed over the past 5 to 10 years, and are there any notable trends?\nHow does UI’s performance in securing research funding compare to that of peer institutions?\n\nBy analyzing data related to these questions, this post will provide valuable insights into UI’s research funding landscape. The findings will help university leadership understand the institution’s strengths, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions to support the university’s research goals. Furthermore, this analysis will contribute to the university’s strategic planning efforts and help ensure the sustainability and growth of its research enterprise."

Due to the lack of end date information provided by USDA, this analysis does not include data from USDA.\nWe utilized two types of bar charts to present the findings. Figure 1 is a simple bar chart that arranges sponsors in order of increasing number of projects expiring in 2024. Projects expiring in 2024 are highlighted using a red channel to emphasize the expiration timeline for each sponsor. Figures 2-4 use stacked bar charts, with principal investigators (PIs) on the x-axis and the total amount of funding for projects ending in 2024 and beyond on the y-axis. Similarly, projects expiring in 2024 are represented using a red channel. The PIs are ordered by decreasing total funding amount, allowing for quick identification of the researchers with the most funding.\nExamining each sponsor individually, it is evident that for both NIH and NSF, the top five PIs in terms of total funding received have significantly higher amounts compared to other researchers, displaying a clear “head” trend in funding distribution (Fig2, 4, Table S1)."

    "text": "3.2 Analyzing Trends in Proportional Representation of New Awards by Funding Source\nTo investigate the trends in new awards from different institutions to the University of Idaho (UI) over the past 10 years, I chose to use a line chart. The line chart effectively reflects trends and allows for a clear comparison of trend changes between institutions. The x-axis represents the starting year of the project as the grant time for new projects, while the y-axis shows the number of new projects awarded by different institutions. The institutions are distinguished using two channels: color and different line styles, which helps readers quickly differentiate between institution types(Fig 5.).\nThe chart reveals that from 2015 to 2021, the number of new projects from USDA showed an initial decline (2015-2018) followed by an increase (2018-2021), maintaining an overall upward trend. However, after 2021, the number of new projects rapidly decreased (2021-2023). For NSF projects, the overall trend remained stable, with the number of projects per year consistently between 10 and 20 over the past decade. Regarding NIH projects, there was a sharp increase in 2015, reaching 35 projects, followed by a steady decline. Although there was a rebound to nearly 20 projects in 2018, it eventually plummeted again. Despite a slight recovery in the past 3 years, the number of projects remains between 0 and 5, similar to the level 10 years ago.\nDOE only had projects in 2020 and 2021, with no new projects granted subsequently.\nIn summary, USDA and NIH have experienced overall declining trends in new projects, with USDA showing more fluctuations and NIH demonstrating a more consistent decrease. NSF, on the other hand, has maintained a relatively stable number of new projects over the past decade. These trends suggest that UI may need to explore new funding sources to compensate for the declines in USDA and NIH funding, while leveraging the stability of NSF support. Further investigation into the potential causes behind these trends, such as changes in funding priorities or shifts in UI’s research focus, could provide valuable insights for informed decision-making and strategic planning."

    "text": "3.3 Comparative Analysis of University of Idaho’s Performance with Peer Institutions\n\n3.3.1 Data Preparation and Metrics\nTo assess the performance of each university, I selected data from the past five years (2019-2023) and processed the data as follows:\nCalculated the average annual funding per project (Mean Award Amount) for each university from different sponsors. This was done by dividing the total funding from each sponsor in a given year by the number of projects. This approach considers both the total funding and the number of projects, eliminating differences due to university size. Subtracted the University of Idaho’s average project funding from each university’s average project funding to determine the relative funding difference. A positive value indicates that the other university received more funding than the University of Idaho, while a negative value indicates less funding. Added the relative funding differences from all four sponsors to obtain the overall funding difference between each university and the University of Idaho for each year (Fig 10). Used a bar chart to visually compare the differences between universities and the University of Idaho across different years, with colors distinguishing the years.\n\n\n3.3.2 Analysis for each sponser\nOverall (Fig 10), the University of Idaho(UI) performs better than Idaho State University, on par with Boise State University and the University of Montana, slightly worse than Washington State University, and significantly behind Montana State University.\n\n3.3.2.1 DOE Analysis\nThe University of Idaho performs similarly to Idaho State University and the University of Montana, worse than Washington State University, and significantly behind Montana State University. Notably, Boise State University received a large grant in 2023, leading to its superior performance compared to UI (Fig 6).\nConsidering these results along with the findings from Q2 regarding the number of projects, UI’s competitiveness in DOE projects appears to be relatively weak.\n\n\n3.3.2.2 NIH Analysis\nUI performs better than Idaho State University but lags behind the other universities in all years except 2022. Combined with the declining trend in the number of NIH projects from Q2, it can be concluded that UI is less competitive than the other universities in securing NIH funding (Fig 7).\n\n\n3.3.2.4 NSF Analysis\nIn NSF projects, UI consistently outperforms the other universities and maintains its lead. Considering the stable trend in the number of new NSF projects from Q2, UI appears to have a strong and consistent competitive edge in NSF projects (Fig 8).\n\n\n3.3.2.5 USDA Analysis\nFor USDA projects, UI consistently outperforms Idaho State University, slightly surpasses Boise State University, marginally lags behind the University of Montana, and significantly trails Washington State University and Montana State University (Fig 9).\nOverall, UI has some competitiveness in USDA projects but falls behind Montana State University and Washington State University."

Network data is characterized by two unique items that are not found in tabular or spatial data - Nodes and Links. In addition, there is a sub-type of network data that we will consider - Hierarchical or Tree data. Let’s practice a few visualizations to get a feel for how these things work.\n\n\nASSIGNMENT1-3\nImprove the network above by:\n\nColoring the edges according to Advisor / BCB520 attribute.\nColoring the nodes according to Department.\nAdujsting the labels to improve readability.\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(igraph)\n\n\nWarning: package 'igraph' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'igraph'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    decompose, spectrum\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:base':\n\n    union\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readxl)\n\n\nWarning: package 'readxl' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nWarning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:igraph':\n\n    as_data_frame, groups, union\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\n\nCode\npeople&lt;-read.csv(\"people.csv\")\nrelations3&lt;-read.csv(\"relations3.csv\")\ng &lt;- graph_from_data_frame(relations3, directed=FALSE, vertices=people)\n\n# 根据Advisor和BCB520属性设置边的颜色\nedge_colors &lt;- ifelse(relations3$Advisor, \"blue\",\n                      ifelse(relations3$BCB520, \"red\", \"grey\"))\n\n# 根据Department设置节点的颜色\ndept_colors &lt;- c(\"Biology\" = \"lightblue\", \"EPPN\" = \"lightgreen\",\n                 \"FCS\" = \"orange\", \"CNR\" = \"yellow\", \n                 \"Math\" = \"pink\", \"PlantSci\" = \"purple\")\nvertex_colors &lt;- dept_colors[V(g)$department]\n\n# 绘制图形,并为图例留出空间\npar(mar = c(1, 1, 1, 7))  # 设置图形的边距,右侧留出更多空间\nplot(g, edge.color = edge_colors, vertex.color = vertex_colors,\n     vertex.label = V(g)$name, vertex.label.color = \"black\",\n     vertex.label.cex = 0.8, vertex.label.dist = 2)\n\n# 添加关系类型图例\nlegend(x = 1.4, y = 1, c(\"Advisor\", \"BCB520\"),\n       lty = 1, col = c(\"blue\", \"red\"),  # 使用线条类型和颜色\n       lwd = 2,  # 设置线条宽度\n       border = NA,\n       bty = \"n\", \n       cex = 0.6,\n       xpd = TRUE,\n       title=\"Relation\")\n\n# 添加部门颜色图例  \nlegend(x = 1.5, y = 0.35, names(dept_colors),  # 调整图例的y坐标\n       pch = 21, pt.bg = dept_colors,  # 使用填充圆形\n       pt.cex = 1.5,  # 设置圆形大小\n       border = NA,\n       bty = \"n\",\n       cex = 0.6, \n       xpd = TRUE,\n       title=\"Department\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\nFig.1 Relationship Network of BCB520 Course and Advisor-Student Interactions across Different Departments. Edge colors: Blue for “Advisor” relationships, Red for “BCB520” relationships, Node colors: Representing different departments (Biology, EPPN, FCS, CNR, Math, PlantSci)\nFigure 1 presents the improved network graph, showcasing the relationships between students, advisors, and course participants in the BCB520.\nThe enhancements made to the network graph include:\n\nEdge colors: Blue edges represent “Advisor” relationships between students and their advisors, while red edges represent “BCB520” relationships, indicating that both individuals are participants in the BCB520 course.\nNode colors: Different colors were used to represent various departments, including Biology, EPPN, FCS, CNR, Math, and PlantSci. Individuals from the same department share the same node color.\nLabel placement: Labels were positioned next to the nodes instead of inside them, enhancing clarity and avoiding overlap. These improvements significantly enhance the visual appeal, interpretability, and ability of the network graph to convey meaningful information about the relationships within the BCB520 course and across different departments.\n\n\n\nASSIGNMENT4\n\nFind the best layout you can for this garbage\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(igraph)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\npeople&lt;-read.csv(\"people.csv\")\nrelations3&lt;-read.csv(\"relations3.csv\")\ng &lt;- graph_from_data_frame(relations3, directed=FALSE, vertices=people)\n\n# 根据Advisor和BCB520属性设置边的颜色\nedge_colors &lt;- ifelse(relations3$Advisor, \"blue\",\n                      ifelse(relations3$BCB520, \"red\", \"grey\"))\n\n# 根据Department设置节点的颜色\ndept_colors &lt;- c(\"Biology\" = \"lightblue\", \"EPPN\" = \"lightgreen\",\n                 \"FCS\" = \"orange\", \"CNR\" = \"yellow\", \n                 \"Math\" = \"pink\", \"PlantSci\" = \"purple\")\nvertex_colors &lt;- dept_colors[V(g)$department]\n\n# 定义绘制子图函数\nplot_subnet &lt;- function(subnet, layout, main) {\n  par(mar = c(1, 1, 1, 7))\n  plot(subnet, edge.color = edge_colors, vertex.color = vertex_colors,\n       vertex.label = V(subnet)$name, vertex.label.color = \"black\",\n       vertex.label.cex = 0.8, vertex.label.dist = 2, \n       layout = layout, main = main)\n}\n\n# 设置拼接图形的布局\npar(mfrow = c(2, 2), mar = c(1, 1, 2, 1))\n\n# 绘制不同布局的子图,并在标题中添加编号\nplot_subnet(g, layout_nicely(g), \"(a) layout_nicely\")\nplot_subnet(g, layout_with_fr(g), \"(b) layout_with_fr\") \nplot_subnet(g, layout_with_kk(g), \"(c) layout_with_kk\")\nplot_subnet(g, layout_with_graphopt(g), \"(d) layout_with_graphopt\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\nFig. 2 Multi-layout Comparison of Relationship Network. (a) layout_nicely: Force-directed layout for aesthetically pleasing visualization with minimal edge crossings, (b) layout_with_fr: Fruchterman-Reingold force-directed layout, attracting connected nodes and repelling unconnected ones, (c) layout_with_kk: Kamada-Kawai force-directed layout based on shortest path distances, revealing symmetry and structure , (d) layout_with_graphopt: Graphopt algorithm layout using simulated annealing, minimizing edge crossings and total graph area,Edge colors: Blue for “Advisor” relationships, Red for “BCB520” relationships, Node colors: Representing different departments (Biology, EPPN, FCS, CNR, Math, PlantSci)\nEventually, I found that the results of these algorithms seem to be very similar, and they can effectively show the relationships and structures in the network"

It includes three distinct attributes: Order, YLD-2017-AB-Ran, YLD-2017-Soda-Ran, and YLD-2017-Walla-Ran, each with 170 items.\n\nOrder: This attribute is ordinal and sequential in nature. It represents a series of 170 unique identifiers for the data entries.\nYLD-2017-AB-Ran: This quantitative attribute reflects a range of values between 73.8 and 101.9. It is associated with the geographical coordinates of 42.96° N latitude and 112.83° W longitude, which corresponds to the AB region.\nYLD-2017-Soda-Ran: Another quantitative attribute, it spans a range from 37.1 to 61.4. The Soda region, located at 42.6544° N latitude and 111.6047° W longitude, is the geographical reference for this attribute.\nYLD-2017-Walla-Ran: Similar to the other YLD attributes, this is also quantitative, with a range of 36.2 to 95.1. It is linked to the Walla region, situated at 46.0646° N latitude and 118.3430° W longitude.\n\nTASK ABSTRACTION\n\nDiscover Outliers where production data exists within the same location;\nCompare the distribution of data across different locations."
