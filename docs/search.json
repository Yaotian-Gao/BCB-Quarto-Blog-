    "text": "1. Preamble\nWheat (Triticum aestivum L.), responsible for a significant portion of global caloric intake, is increasingly threatened by both natural and anthropogenic factors, including climate change and geopolitical unrest (Zhang et al. 2022). These challenges underline the urgency for innovative approaches in wheat breeding, beyond the capabilities of traditional methods. Genomic Selection (GS) represents a transformative approach, leveraging high-throughput genotyping technologies to overcome the limitations of conventional breeding by enabling more precise genetic selection for desired traits(Heffner et al. 2009).\nSeveral factors can influence the prediction accuracy of GS models, including population structure, training population size, and the choice of prediction models (Plavšin et al. 2021). Selecting an appropriate prediction model is a relatively straightforward approach to improve prediction accuracy among these factors. Traditional GS models like Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (GBLUP) and Ridge Regression (RR) have been foundational, yet they often fail to capture non-linear genetic interactions critical for complex traits like yield (Desta and Ortiz 2014). Emerging models such as Random Forest (RF) and Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) offer potential improvements by accounting for these complexities . This study aims to explore the predictive capabilities of these advanced models, focusing exclusively on wheat yield (YLD) as a primary trait of interest.\nThe data for this analysis stems from a comprehensive dataset encompassing 250 spring wheat lines from diverse genetic backgrounds, evaluated under varying environmental conditions. Six statistical models, namely Ridge Regression (RR), Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (GBLUP), Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF), were evaluated to identify the optimal model for YLD. Through rigorous analysis and visualization of the genetic predictors of yield, we anticipate fostering a deeper understanding of GS’s potential to address pressing food security challenges.\n\n\n2. Data and Code\nPlant Material\nThis study involves 250 spring wheat varieties and elite lines, developed by breeding programs in the Northwestern Pacific region of the United States and the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) in Mexico City, Mexico. The collection includes three market categories of spring wheat cultivated in the Americas: soft white spring, hard white spring, and hard red spring, with over 50% of the lines serving as foundational lines for regional variety development programs.\nPhenotypic Evaluation\nThe wheat panel was evaluated across five distinct environments, labeled E1 to E5 (E1 = 2016, E2 = 2017, E3 = 2021, E4 = 2022, E5 = 2023), at a field trial location in Aberdeen, Idaho (42°56’36” N and 112°50’22” W). The trial layout was a randomized complete block design with two replicates. Each genotype was planted in 3.0 m plots consisting of seven rows, with a row spacing of 21 cm. Yield per hectare (kg/ha) was measured in four of these trials (E1, E2, E4, E5).\nGenotyping\nThe population was genotyped using Illumina’s 90K iSelect SNPchip. Raw data was provided by the USDA/ARS Cereal Crops Research Unit and was analyzed using Genome Studio v2.0.5(Illumina 2010) for processing its raw data. Polymorphic markers were identified as exhibiting clear, distinct clusters in Genome Studio, with a minimum distance of 0.20 between the polar coordinates of normalized theta intensities. Markers were further filtered based on missing data (&gt;10%) and minor allele frequency (&lt;5%) using TASSEL v5.2.89 (Bradbury et al. 2007).\nData Dictionary | Field | Description | Data Type | | ——— | ———————————————————— | ——— | | ENT | Unique identifier for each wheat variety, numbered from 52001 to 52250 | Integer | | Source | Source of the plant material, including universities (UI, UCD, WSU), CIMMYT, MSU, USDA, and other sources (commercial varieties and international germplasm) | String | | YLD_E1 | Yield in kilograms per hectare for environment E1 (2016) | Float | | YLD_E2 | Yield in kilograms per hectare for environment E2 (2017) | Float | | YLD_E4 | Yield in kilograms per hectare for environment E4 (2022) | Float | | YLD_E5 | Yield in kilograms per hectare for environment E5 (2023) | Float | | YLD_BLUPs | Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP) values for yield, calculated from the yields of environments E1, E2, E4, and E5.

The SVM model consistently showed the lowest prediction accuracies，while RKHS and RF demonstrated similar and superior performance compared to the other models, including the widely used GBLUP and RR\nConsidering the comparable performance of RKHS and RF, we selected RF as the optimal model for genomic prediction in this study. Second, Charmet et al.(2020a) previously evaluated the computational efficiency of various prediction methods using a set of 47,839 markers and 100 independent 10-fold cross-validations. They found that RF (382 minutes) was considerably less computationally intensive than RKHS (637 minutes), making RF a more practical choice for large-scale genomic prediction applications.\nTesting Prediction across Environment\n\n\nCode\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"merged_GP502-RF-YLD.16Modify.17.22.23_filtered.csv\")\n\nlibrary(tidyr)\ndata_long &lt;- gather(data, key = \"Measurement\", value = \"Value\", BLUPs_RF:E5_RF)\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nmy_colors &lt;- c(\"BLUPs_RF\" = \"Red\", \"E3_RF\" =\"#8DD3C7\", \"E4_RF\" = \"#FDB462\", \"E5_RF\" =\"#80B1D3\", \"E1_RF\"=\"yellow\", \"E2_RF\"=\"#D8BFD8\")\n\nggplot(data_long, aes(x = ...2\n, y = Value, fill = Measurement)) +\n  geom_boxplot(position = position_dodge(width = 0.75), width = 0.5) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = my_colors) +\n  labs(title = \"\",\n       x = \"Training Environment\", y = \"Prediction Accuracy for YLD\", fill=\"\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\", colour = NA),   \n        panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\", colour = NA), \n        legend.title = element_text(size = 14),       \n        legend.text = element_text(size = 12),        \n        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12),       \n        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12),       \n        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 0), \n        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),        \n        #legend.position = \"null\",                    \n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0))         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRAITS\nTRAINING ENVIRONMENTS\nPREDICTION ENVIRONMENTS\nPREDICTION ACCURACIES A\n\n\n\n\nYLD\nBLUPs\nBLUPs\n0.424\n\n\n\n\nE1\n0.369\n\n\n\n\nE2\n0.325\n\n\n\n\nE4\n0.189\n\n\n\n\nE5\n0.240\n\n\nYLD\nE1\nBLUPs\n0.288\n\n\n\n\nE1\n0.565\n\n\n\n\nE2\n0.277\n\n\n\n\nE4\n0.109\n\n\n\n\nE5\n-0.052\n\n\nYLD\nE2\nBLUPs\n0.319\n\n\n\n\nE1\n0.343\n\n\n\n\nE2\n0.360\n\n\n\n\nE4\n0.140\n\n\n\n\nE5\n0.041\n\n\nYLD\nE4\nBLUPs\n0.161\n\n\n\n\nE1\n0.242\n\n\n\n\nE2\n0.129\n\n\n\n\nE4\n0.078\n\n\n\n\nE5\n0.058\n\n\nYLD\nE5\nBLUPs\n0.259\n\n\n\n\nE1\n0.024\n\n\n\n\nE2\n0.053\n\n\n\n\nE4\n0.127\n\n\n\n\nE5\n0.395\n\n\n\nIn this study, we investigated the prediction accuracy of yield-related traits (HD, PHT, TKW, and tSNS) and yield (YLD) across different environments using the optimal model determined in the previous section (Random Forest with 80% of the population as the training set). Prediction accuracies are reported as the median value.\nSingle-environment models were trained by training and predicting within the same environment. For YLD, the prediction accuracies were highest for environment E1 and BLUPs, respectively. BLUPs outperformed 80% of the evaluation environments.When models were trained in one environment and used to predict in different environments, substantial variation in prediction accuracy was observed across environment combinations for all traits. For YLD, prediction accuracy ranged from -0.052 to 0.565 for different training-testing environment combinations, and from 0.189 to 0.424 when using BLUPs to train the model.Overall, BLUPs were best suited for training models to predict values in unknown environments, whether using single-environment models or cross-environment models.\n\n\n4. Conclusion\nWheat is a staple food crop worldwide, with its yield improvement being crucial for food security. Genomic selection accelerates the breeding process and enhances genetic gains in wheat. This study demonstrated the potential of genomic prediction models, particularly Random Forest, in predicting yield. And BLUPs data is the best data set for training and prediction.\n\n\n5.

Network data is characterized by two unique items that are not found in tabular or spatial data - Nodes and Links.

    "text": "首先，我需要写一段Preamble。在作业中对该段落的要求如下：\nWrite a brief paragraph describing the primary question or purpose of the post. Ideally, the concept should be challenging enough that it requires at least two visualizations that use different idioms (ie. don’t just make two scatterplots with different variables). The concept should also be challenging enough that it captures the interest of the reader (i.e. a plot of height and weight that shows they are correlated is trivial and not appropriate). The best approach is to explore a topic or question in which YOU are very interested.\n现在，请你针对这一要求，修改以下的Introduction部分，使其符合要求。注意保留参考文献的引用。词数控制在300词左右：\n*Introduction*\nWheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is one of the most important cereal crops worldwide, providing around 20% of the global caloric intake (Shiferaw et al. 2013). However, both natural and anthropogenic factors are posing significant threats to global food security. An analysis of wheat breeding data in North America from 1960 to 2018 suggests that the current pace of variety improvement may not be sufficient to keep up with the negative impacts of climate change on wheat production (Zhang et al. 2022). Furthermore, the Ukraine-Russia war in 2022 has disrupted one-third of the global wheat exports, which is likely to have severe repercussions on global food security for months, if not years, to come (Bentley et al. 2022). Given these challenges, enhancing wheat yield remains a critical priority in wheat breeding efforts to ensure sustainable food production and global food security.\nYield is a complex trait influenced by multiple factors; therefore, identifying and targeting important yield-related traits is crucial for yield improvement (Isham et al. 2021). Yield components, such as spikelet number per spike and thousand kernel weight, typically show higher heritability than grain yield itself (Wang et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2018). Plant height is another key trait closely associated with plant architecture, lodging resistance, and yield performance (Wang et al. 2017b). Additionally, heading date can significantly influence wheat adaptability to different environments, thus affecting yield (Chen et al. 2022). Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of yield and yield-related traits and their genetic basis is essential for developing high-yielding wheat varieties through targeted breeding efforts.\nDespite the importance of these traits, their phenotypic evaluation can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. Currently, traditional breeding methods, such as hybridization and phenotypic selection, remain essential components of wheat breeding programs (Ahmar et al. 2020a). However, these approaches have several limitations. Firstly, field trials require substantial resources, including land, labor, and time, often taking up to 10-20 years to develop new varieties. Secondly, phenotypic data collection faces challenges such as the need for large-scale manual measurements, potential subjectivity in assessments, and the influence of environmental factors (Ahmar et al. 2020b; Cha et al. 2023). These limitations highlight the need for more efficient and cost-effective approaches to accelerate the wheat breeding process and improve the accuracy of trait evaluation.\nThe rapid advancement of low-cost, high-throughput genotyping technologies has provided wheat breeders with an abundance of molecular markers spanning the entire genome, facilitating the development of genomic selection (GS) as a promising tool to address the limitations of traditional breeding methods. GS utilizes genome-wide markers to capture the genetic relationships among individuals, enabling the evaluation of complex traits controlled by multiple genes (Zhang et al. 2007). The GS process typically involves a reference population and a breeding population. First, phenotypic and genotypic data from the reference population are used to train a prediction model. Subsequently, the trained model and genotypic data of the breeding population are employed to calculate the genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs) for the individuals in the breeding population(Larkin et al. 2019). Finally, individuals within the breeding population can be determined using GEBVs, even in the absence of phenotypic information(Xu et al. 2020). Heffner et al. (2009) highlighted that GS has the potential to accelerate breeding cycles, increase genetic gain per unit time, and significantly improve the efficiency of breeding programs by reducing the reliance on extensive phenotyping.\nSeveral factors can influence the prediction accuracy of GS models, including population structure, training population size, and the choice of prediction models (Plavšin et al. 2021). Selecting an appropriate prediction model is a relatively straightforward approach to improve prediction accuracy among these factors. GS models encompass both parametric methods (e.g., Ridge Regression) and non-parametric methods (e.g., Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space and Random Forest), which differ in their assumptions and handling of marker effects (Desta and Ortiz 2014). In theory, non-parametric methods, which account for non-additive marker effects, should outperform parametric methods. However, the reality is more complex. For instance, Joshi et al. (2024) found that Ridge Regression best explained the variability in the phenotypic expression when predicting test weight in wheat. In another study, Ali et al. (2020) investigated the prediction of grain yield and five other yield-related traits in wheat, including spike number per square meter, thousand kernel weight, spike length, heading date, and plant height. They discovered that the best-performing model varied for each trait. These findings underscore the importance of evaluating and comparing different GS models for specific traits and datasets to identify the most suitable approach. Further research is needed to explore optimal models that maximize prediction ability and computational efficiency across a wide range of traits and datasets.\nGS has been successfully applied in wheat breeding for various objectives, including yield improvement, disease resistance, and quality traits, and has even been explored for the domestication of new crops (Rasheed and Xia 2019). However, studies focusing on the application of GS for predicting yield and yield-related traits in wheat, particularly in spring wheat, are still limited. Therefore, further investigations are needed to assess the potential of GS in improving these economically important traits.\nThe present study aims to assess the genomic prediction accuracy of different models, including parametric and semi-parametric approaches, in predicting plant height (PHT), total spikelet number per spike (tSNS), heading date (HD), thousand kernel weight (TKW), and yield (YLD) in spring wheat. Six statistical models, namely Ridge Regression (RR), Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (GBLUP), Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF), were evaluated to identify the optimal model for each trait. The study was conducted using a diverse panel of 250 spring wheat lines, encompassing three market classes (soft white spring, hard white spring, and hard red spring) By leveraging the power of genomic prediction and utilizing a diverse spring wheat population evaluated in multiple environments, this research aims to facilitate precise breeding for improved yield and yield-related traits in spring wheat.\n要求：\nData\nWrite a summary of the data sources you will use. Include a Data Dictionary table that fully describes each individual data file used. You may use your own research data or publicly available data from any source you like (with attribution). There aren’t any minimum or maximum data set size requirements, other than you need something big enough to be interesting and not so big that we don’t have a supercomputer capable of creating your visualization.\n相关的资料如下：\nPlant Material\nThis study selected 250 spring wheat varieties and elite lines (Supplemental Table 1). This collection was developed by breeding programs in the Northwestern Pacific region of the United States and the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT, Mexico City, Mexico). It encompasses three market categories of spring wheat cultivated in the Americas: soft white spring, hard white spring, and hard red spring, with the majority of the lines (&gt;50%) serving as founding lines for variety development programs in the region.\nPhenotypic Evaluation\nThe panel was evaluated across five environments, designated as E1 to E5, with each year considered a distinct environment (E1 = 2016, E2 = 2017, E3 = 2021, E4 = 2022, E5 = 2023). The field trials were conducted at Aberdeen, Idaho located at 42°56’36” N and 112°50’22” W. The field design was a randomized complete block with two replicates. Each genotype was planted in 3.0 m plots consisting of seven rows, with a row spacing of 21 cm.\nYield per acre (YLD) in kilograms per hectare (kg/ha) was evaluated in four trials (E1, E2, E4, E5).\nGenotyping\nThe population was genotyped using Illumina’s 90K iSelect SNPchip. Raw data was provided by the USDA/ARS Cereal Crops Research Unit and was analyzed using Genome Studio v2.0.5(Illumina 2010) for processing its raw data. Polymorphic markers were identified as exhibiting clear, distinct clusters in Genome Studio, with a minimum distance of 0.20 between the polar coordinates of normalized theta intensities. Markers were further filtered based on missing data (&gt;10%) and minor allele frequency (&lt;5%) using TASSEL v5.2.89 (Bradbury et al. 2007).\n我的文件储存在YLD.csv文件中\n另外，这是一个.qmd文件。请问要求中的Data Dictionary table 是不是需要特殊设置呢？\n\nData Dictionary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\nDescription\nData Type\n\n\n\n\nENT\nUnique identifier for each wheat variety, numbered from 52001 to 52250\nInteger\n\n\nSource\nSource of the plant material, including universities (UI, UCD, WSU), CIMMYT, MSU, USDA, and other sources (commercial varieties and international germplasm)\nString\n\n\nYLD_E1\nYield in kilograms per hectare for environment E1 (2016)\nFloat\n\n\nYLD_E2\nYield in kilograms per hectare for environment E2 (2017)\nFloat\n\n\nYLD_E4\nYield in kilograms per hectare for environment E4 (2022)\nFloat\n\n\nYLD_E5\nYield in kilograms per hectare for environment E5 (2023)\nFloat\n\n\nYLD_BLUPs\nBest Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP) values for yield, calculated from the yields of environments E1, E2, E4, and E5.

utilized lines as markers and position as the channel. Since position on a common scale is the highest-ranking channel for ordered attributes, it allows for easy differentiation of production levels across different locations.In Figure 2, I again used lines as markers but employed color as the channel. Because color is a lower-ranking channel for ordered attributes, it does not easily distinguish production levels across different locations.\nIn Figures 3 and 4, I used lines and areas as marks, differentiating them using color and position. The distinction is that, in Figure 3, I used contrasting colors like blue, red, and green to differentiate various locations, whereas in Figure 4, I used shades of gray, including light gray, gray, and dark gray, which made the chart more difficult to distinguish.\nIn Figures 5 and 6, both utilized lines and areas as marks, with position as the differentiator. The difference in Figure 6 is the addition of color as an extra channel. While redundancy can be desirable, area interferes with hue, with larger shapes having more visual salience.\nIn Figures 7 and 8, I demonstrated the use of lines to represent the average monthly temperatures during the wheat growing season across different locations. The key difference is that in Figure 7, I used a red popout to highlight Aberdeen’s temperature curve, making it easy to locate. In contrast, in Figure 8, I used the same color for all three locations, making it difficult to immediately identify the curve for Aberdeen."

What might picks in the range of pick 31 conceivably yield? How often do picks in that range yield players of Elias Lindholm’s value?\nI guess we’d better figure out what Elias Lindholm brings to the table.\nCan you find him in our existing data? Can you think of a way to highlight him in the context of number of games played? What other kinds of data might we need to fairly evaluate Lindholm and pick 31?\nYou will be surprised how these seemingly simple questions force you to explore the nuances of working with and visualizing tabular data."

Add visual channels to this plot that will help us make that decision.\n\nAnswer：To address the strategy of trading a first-round pick for second and third-round picks, adding color coding to the visualization can greatly enhance decision-making clarity. Specifically, we could represent first-round picks in red, second-round picks in yellow, and third-round picks in blue. This color scheme will provide an immediate visual distinction between the rounds, aiding in the evaluation of the value proposition of such trades。\n\nCreate a caption and better axis labels for this figure.\n\nAnswer: For the figure caption and improved axis labels, a proposed caption could be: “2018 NHL Draft: Analyzing the Impact of Draft Position on Career Progression.” The horizontal axis label could be refined to “Overall Draft Position,” clearly indicating the sequence in which players were selected in the draft. The vertical axis label could be enhanced to “NHL Games Played,” directly correlating the draft position with professional performance metrics.\n\nWhat if we wanted to use more than just the 2018 draft class?\n\nAnswer: To incorporate data beyond the 2018 draft class, creating separate scatter plots for each year could be one approach. Alternatively, integrating the data into a single comprehensive chart using varied colors or markers to differentiate between years could provide a holistic view of trends over time, facilitating a more informed comparison across different draft classes."

This arrangement facilitates an intuitive analysis of the relationship between draft round and overall draft position, aiding in the decision-making process.\n\nMaking a caption and better axis labels.\n\nAnswer:\n\na suggested caption is: “2018 NHL Draft: Analyzing Player Performance by Draft Position.” This title concisely communicates the chart’s purpose. Enhancing the x-axis label to “Overall Draft Position” and the y-axis label to “Total NHL Games Played” will clarify the axes’ significance, focusing on the broader trends rather than individual player names.\n\n\nFixing the values of the x axis labels so they aren’t such a mess.\n\nAnswer: To address the clutter of x-axis labels, substituting individual names with their overall draft positions is a practical solution. This approach maintains the chart’s relevance to decision-making by emphasizing positional data over personal identification, streamlining the visual representation for better analysis."

Different positions have varying demands and expectations, which can impact the metrics used to evaluate a player’s success and contribution.\nIs the number of NHL games played really the best metric to use?\nAnswer: Regarding the metric of NHL games played, it is not the most comprehensive measure of a player’s potential or contribution. Relying solely on this metric can overlook important aspects such as the quality of performance, impact on team success, and other valuable skills brought to the game. A more holistic evaluation should incorporate multiple metrics to capture a player’s overall impact and value more accurately."
